To run this file on an ES5 or almost ES5\n * implementation where the {@code WeakMap} specification does not\n * quite conform, run <code>repairES5.js</code> first.\n *\n * <p>Even though WeakMapModule is not global, the linter thinks it\n * is, which is why it is in the overrides list below.\n *\n * <p>NOTE: Before using this WeakMap emulation in a non-SES\n * environment, see the note below about hiddenRecord.\n *\n * @author Mark S. Miller\n * @requires crypto, ArrayBuffer, Uint8Array, navigator, console\n * @overrides WeakMap, ses, Proxy\n * @overrides WeakMapModule\n */\n\n/**\n * This {@code WeakMap} emulation is observably equivalent to the\n * ES-Harmony WeakMap, but with leakier garbage collection properties.\n *\n * <p>As with true WeakMaps, in this emulation, a key does not\n * retain maps indexed by that key and (crucially) a map does not\n * retain the keys it indexes. A map by itself also does not retain\n * the values associated with that map.\n *\n * <p>However, the values associated with a key in some map are\n * retained so long as that key is retained and those associations are\n * not overridden. For example, when used to support membranes, all\n * values exported from a given membrane will live for the lifetime\n * they would have had in the absence of an interposed membrane. Even\n * when the membrane is revoked, all objects that would have been\n * reachable in the absence of revocation will still be reachable, as\n * far as the GC can tell, even though they will no longer be relevant\n * to ongoing computation.\n *\n * <p>The API implemented here is approximately the API as implemented\n * in FF6.0a1 and agreed to by MarkM, Andreas Gal, and Dave Herman,\n * rather than the offially approved proposal page. TODO(erights):\n * upgrade the ecmascript WeakMap proposal page to explain this API\n * change and present to EcmaScript committee for their approval.\n *\n * <p>The first difference between the emulation here and that in\n * FF6.0a1 is the presence of non enumerable {@code get___, has___,\n * set___, and delete___} methods on WeakMap instances to represent\n * what would be the hidden internal properties of a primitive\n * implementation. Whereas the FF6.0a1 WeakMap.prototype methods\n * require their {@code this} to be a genuine WeakMap instance (i.e.,\n * an object of {@code [[Class]]} \"WeakMap}), since there is nothing\n * unforgeable about the pseudo-internal method names used here,\n * nothing prevents these emulated prototype methods from being\n * applied to non-WeakMaps with pseudo-internal methods of the same\n * names.\n *\n * <p>Another difference is that our emulated {@code\n * WeakMap.prototype} is not itself a WeakMap. A problem with the\n * current FF6.0a1 API is that WeakMap.prototype is itself a WeakMap\n * providing ambient mutability and an ambient communications\n * channel. Thus, if a WeakMap is already present and has this\n * problem, repairES5.js wraps it in a safe wrappper in order to\n * prevent access to this channel. (See\n * PATCH_MUTABLE_FROZEN_WEAKMAP_PROTO in repairES5.js).\n */\n\n/**\n * If this is a full <a href=\n * \"http://code.google.com/p/es-lab/wiki/SecureableES5\"\n * >secureable ES5</a> platform and the ES-Harmony {@code WeakMap} is\n * absent, install an approximate emulation.\n *\n * <p>If WeakMap is present but cannot store some objects, use our approximate\n * emulation as a wrapper.\n *\n * <p>If this is almost a secureable ES5 platform, then WeakMap.js\n * should be run after repairES5.js.\n *\n * <p>See {@code WeakMap} for documentation of the garbage collection\n * properties of this WeakMap emulation.\n */\n(function WeakMapModule() {\n  \"use strict\";\n\n  if (typeof ses !== 'undefined' && ses.ok && !ses.ok()) {\n    // already too broken, so give up\n    return;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * In some cases (current Firefox), we must make a choice betweeen a\n   * WeakMap which is capable of using all varieties of host objects as\n   * keys and one which is capable of safely using proxies as keys.

present, then it conforms to the anticipated ES6\n * specification. To run this file on an ES5 or almost ES5\n * implementation where the {@code WeakMap} specification does not\n * quite conform, run <code>repairES5.js</code> first.\n *\n * <p>Even though WeakMapModule is not global, the linter thinks it\n * is, which is why it is in the overrides list below.\n *\n * <p>NOTE: Before using this WeakMap emulation in a non-SES\n * environment, see the note below about hiddenRecord.\n *\n * @author Mark S. Miller\n * @requires crypto, ArrayBuffer, Uint8Array, navigator, console\n * @overrides WeakMap, ses, Proxy\n * @overrides WeakMapModule\n */\n\n/**\n * This {@code WeakMap} emulation is observably equivalent to the\n * ES-Harmony WeakMap, but with leakier garbage collection properties.\n *\n * <p>As with true WeakMaps, in this emulation, a key does not\n * retain maps indexed by that key and (crucially) a map does not\n * retain the keys it indexes. A map by itself also does not retain\n * the values associated with that map.\n *\n * <p>However, the values associated with a key in some map are\n * retained so long as that key is retained and those associations are\n * not overridden. For example, when used to support membranes, all\n * values exported from a given membrane will live for the lifetime\n * they would have had in the absence of an interposed membrane. Even\n * when the membrane is revoked, all objects that would have been\n * reachable in the absence of revocation will still be reachable, as\n * far as the GC can tell, even though they will no longer be relevant\n * to ongoing computation.\n *\n * <p>The API implemented here is approximately the API as implemented\n * in FF6.0a1 and agreed to by MarkM, Andreas Gal, and Dave Herman,\n * rather than the offially approved proposal page. TODO(erights):\n * upgrade the ecmascript WeakMap proposal page to explain this API\n * change and present to EcmaScript committee for their approval.\n *\n * <p>The first difference between the emulation here and that in\n * FF6.0a1 is the presence of non enumerable {@code get___, has___,\n * set___, and delete___} methods on WeakMap instances to represent\n * what would be the hidden internal properties of a primitive\n * implementation. Whereas the FF6.0a1 WeakMap.prototype methods\n * require their {@code this} to be a genuine WeakMap instance (i.e.,\n * an object of {@code [[Class]]} \"WeakMap}), since there is nothing\n * unforgeable about the pseudo-internal method names used here,\n * nothing prevents these emulated prototype methods from being\n * applied to non-WeakMaps with pseudo-internal methods of the same\n * names.\n *\n * <p>Another difference is that our emulated {@code\n * WeakMap.prototype} is not itself a WeakMap. A problem with the\n * current FF6.0a1 API is that WeakMap.prototype is itself a WeakMap\n * providing ambient mutability and an ambient communications\n * channel. Thus, if a WeakMap is already present and has this\n * problem, repairES5.js wraps it in a safe wrappper in order to\n * prevent access to this channel. (See\n * PATCH_MUTABLE_FROZEN_WEAKMAP_PROTO in repairES5.js).\n */\n\n/**\n * If this is a full <a href=\n * \"http://code.google.com/p/es-lab/wiki/SecureableES5\"\n * >secureable ES5</a> platform and the ES-Harmony {@code WeakMap} is\n * absent, install an approximate emulation.\n *\n * <p>If WeakMap is present but cannot store some objects, use our approximate\n * emulation as a wrapper.\n *\n * <p>If this is almost a secureable ES5 platform, then WeakMap.js\n * should be run after repairES5.js.\n *\n * <p>See {@code WeakMap} for documentation of the garbage collection\n * properties of this WeakMap emulation.\n */\n(function WeakMapModule() {\n  \"use strict\";\n\n  if (typeof ses !== 'undefined' && ses.ok && !ses.ok()) {\n    // already too broken, so give up\n    return;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * In some cases (current Firefox), we must make a choice betweeen a\n   * WeakMap which is capable of using all varieties of host objects as\n   * keys and one which is capable of safely using proxies as keys.
